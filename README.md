# Computer Cribbage
 A Cribbage game that I made in C++

### Project Overview:

A computer version of the card game *Cribbage*, made in C++. I started with just the point counting system for now, but I 
want it to eventually be a playable game instead of a point counter.

*GAME IS NOT "DONE"*

Check in often for updates!

- [X] ~Finish Point Counting System~ (It's almost done, it's as done as it's getting until I add card suits)

- [X] ~Push program and files~

- [ ] Start working on some basic stuff such as the bot to play against and card suit implementation (Get basic Cribbage stuff working)


### Plans for future:
Make a bot to play against, make it function like the actual game, make it simple and easy for beginners, show detailed point counting, etc.
