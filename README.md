# Cribbage
 A Cribbage game that I made in C++

### Project Overview:

A computer version of the card game *Cribbage*, made in C++. I started with just the point counting system for now, but I 
want it to eventually be a playable game instead of a point counter.

*GAME IS NOT DONE, NO SOURCE CODE FILES ARE UPLOADED YET!!!*

This is my first attempt at a project like this, so if it feels too stressful or overwhelming, the repo may be taken down and deleted.

For now though, check in often for updates!

[] Finish Point Counting System
[] Push program and files


### Plans for future:
Make a bot to play against, make it function like the actual game, make it simple and easy for beginners, show detailed point counting, etc.
